## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Observability, dependency-free. `WithObserver(func(ctx, Trace))` fires once per request attempt on every path (success, non-2xx, network error, decode error) with metadata only — no bodies or headers.
- `Trace` type carrying method, URL, request/response byte counts, status, duration, typed error, attempt number, and optional connection-phase timings.
- `WithConnTrace()` populates DNS/Connect/TLS/TTFB timings via `net/http/httptrace`.
- curl rendering: `Curl(ctx, endpoint, opts...)` returns the request as a runnable `curl` command without sending; `WithCurl(func(curl string))` hands it to a callback just before `Do` sends; `RequestCurl(*http.Request)` renders any request. Headers are sorted and shell-quoted; the body is read without being consumed.
- `WithBasicAuth(user, password)` for HTTP Basic authentication.
- `WithFormBody(url.Values)` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies (OAuth token endpoints, classic form posts).
- `WithResponseBytes(*[]byte)` captures the raw response body for any status and any content type — the way to read non-JSON responses.
- `WithErrorInto(any)` decodes a structured error payload from a non-2xx body while still returning the `HTTPError`.
- `WithUserAgent(string)` and a default `User-Agent` of `httpreq/<version>` (sent only when the caller sets none; pass `""` to suppress). Exposed as `Version` and `DefaultUserAgent`.
- `WithResponseWriter(io.Writer)` streams a successful response body to a writer via `io.Copy` instead of buffering — for downloads larger than memory. Error responses are still buffered into the `HTTPError`.
- `WithExpectStatus(...int)` accepts additional status codes (e.g. 304 Not Modified) as success instead of returning an `HTTPError`.
- `WithRequest(func(*http.Request) error)` hook mutates the fully built request just before send — for request signing, or fields net/http keeps off the header map (Host, cookies, Close, Trailer). Runs for `Curl` too; a returned error aborts before sending.
- `WithHeaders(http.Header)` and `WithQuery(url.Values)` bulk setters, adding a whole set of headers or query params at once (append semantics).
- `SlogObserver(*slog.Logger, slog.Level)` adapter for structured logging (stdlib `log/slog`); failures log at `ERROR`.
- Runnable `Example` functions (pkg.go.dev snippets, compiled and verified by `go test`) for `Do`, `HTTPError`, `WithObserver`, `SlogObserver`, and `WithConnTrace`.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Initial release. Stdlib-only.
- `Do(ctx, url, opts...)` JSON-over-HTTP convenience.
- Options: `WithMethod`, `WithHeader`, `WithBearerToken`, `WithQueryParam`,
